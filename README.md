# Secrets

I have implemented and completed the challenge from my web development course. The challenge required the use of OAuth 2.0 for user authentication and authorization. I used Facebook and Google login with the help of NodeJS and Passport. Passport is a tool for Node that verifies the authenticity of requests and then allows the application to handle other tasks.
